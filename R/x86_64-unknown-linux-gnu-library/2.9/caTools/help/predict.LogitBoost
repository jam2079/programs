_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Prediction or Testing using logitboost classification algorithm

_U_s_a_g_e:

     ## S3 method for class 'LogitBoost':
     predict(object, xtest, type = c("class", "raw"), nIter=NA, ...)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

  object: An object of class "LogitBoost" see "Value" section of 
          'LogitBoost' for details

   xtest: A matrix or data frame with test data. Rows contain samples 
          and columns contain features

    type: See "Value" section

   nIter: An optional integer, used to lower number of iterations 
          (decision stumps) used in the decision making. If not
          provided than the  number will be the same as the one
          provided in 'LogitBoost'.  If provided than the results will
          be the same as running  'LogitBoost' with fewer iterations. 

     ...: not used but needed for compatibility with generic predict 
          method

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     Logitboost algorithm relies on a voting scheme to make
     classifications. Many ('nIter' of them) week classifiers are
     applied to each sample and their findings are used as votes to
     make the final classification. The class with  the most votes
     "wins". However, with this scheme it is common for two cases  have
     a tie (the same number of votes), especially if number of
     iterations is  even. In that case NA is returned, instead of a
     label.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     If type = "class" (default) label of the class with maximal
     probability is  returned for each sample. If type = "raw", the
     a-posterior probabilities for  each class are returned.
