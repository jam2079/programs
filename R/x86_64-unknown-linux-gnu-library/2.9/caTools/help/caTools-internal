                  endrule=c("NA", "trim", "keep", "constant", "func"),

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

       x: numeric vector of length n

       k: width of moving window; must be an integer between one and n.

    dimx: original dimension of x (usually 'dim(x)') used to choose 
          dimentions of the output. 

 endrule: character string indicating how the values at the beginning 
          and the end, of the data, should be treated. Only first and
          last 'k2'  values at both ends are affected, where 'k2' is
          the half-bandwidth  'k2 = k %/% 2'.

             *  '"mad"' - applies the mad function to smaller and
                smaller sections of the array. Equivalent to:  'for(i
                in 1:k2) out[i]=mad(x[1:(i+k2)])'. 

             *  '"trim"' - trim the ends; output array length is equal
                to  'length(x)-2*k2 (out = out[(k2+1):(n-k2)])'. This
                option mimics  output of 'apply' '(embed(x,k),1,FUN)'
                and other  related functions.

             *  '"keep"' - fill the ends with numbers from 'x' vector 
                '(out[1:k2] = x[1:k2])'. This option makes more sense
                in case of  smoothing functions, kept here for
                consistency.

             *  '"constant"' - fill the ends with first and last
                calculated  value in output array '(out[1:k2] =
                out[k2+1])'

             *  '"NA"' - fill the ends with NA's '(out[1:k2] = NA)'

             *  '"func"' - same as '"mad"' option except that
                implemented in R for testing purposes. Avoid since it
                can be very slow for large windows.

       y: numeric vector of length n, which is partially filled output
          of  one of the 'run' functions. Function 'EndRule' will fill
          the  remaining beginning and end sections using method chosen
          by 'endrule'  argument.

   align: specifies whether result should be centered (default), 
          left-aligned or right-aligned. 

    Func: Function name that 'EndRule' will use in case of 
          'endrule="func"'.

     ...: Additional parameters to 'Func' that 'EndRule' will  use in
          case of 'endrule="func"'.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     Returns a numeric vector of the same length as 'x'. Only in case
     of  'endrule="trim"'.the output will be shorter.
