_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Return a cyclic redundancy checksum for each element in the
     argument.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     cksum(a)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

       a: coerced to character vector

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     'NA''s appearing in the argument are returned as 'NA''s.

     The default calculation is identical to that given in pseudo-code
     in the ACM article (in the References).

_V_a_l_u_e:

     numeric vector of the same length as 'a'.

_A_u_t_h_o_r(_s):

_R_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e_s:

     Fashioned from 'cksum(1)' UNIX command line utility, i.e., 'man
     cksum'.

     Via Table Lookup, _Communications of the ACM_ *31*, 8, 1008-1013.

_S_e_e _A_l_s_o:

     'bitShiftL', 'bitAnd', etc.

_E_x_a_m_p_l_e_s:

        b <- "I would rather have a bottle in front of me than frontal lobotomy\n"
      stopifnot(cksum(b) == 1342168430)
      (bv <- strsplit(b, " ")[[1]])
      cksum(bv) # now a vector of length 13
